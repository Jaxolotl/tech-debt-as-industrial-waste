# TECH-DEBT AS WASTE MANAGEMENT IN SOFTWARE INDUSTRY

## Introduction

– Let's talk about **TECH-DEBT**
– That thing again? **WHY?!**

Do you find yourself in this conversation? (－‸ლ) **EXACTLY!**  Unfortunately, we tend to adapt to discomfort and without finding a solution to common a pain we end up ignoring the ringing alarm for good.  
I've seen this repeating pattern many times in my career especially when dealing with TECH-DEBT, so I started walking backwards to try to understand why, after so many years, this is still an issue.

## The Beginning

Let's start with some history first:

### The "discovery"

Is hard to talk in terms of "world wide software industry" before the early 90's if we consider "industry" as a production system for a large [consumer base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_base), **Microsoft Windows** was released on [November, 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#1985%E2%80%931994:_Windows_and_Office) and **Classic Mac OS** in [January, 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS) but still, at that time, a lot of amazing high-level programming language like COBOL or Fortran were already there since decades before and many great minds were around and thinking how to make things better and had a clear understanding of the consequences of producing **"not-quite-right-code"**.

### The Metaphor

In 1992 the amazing [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) used the analogy of a financial [debt](http://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html) to refer to that **"not-quite-right-code"** (you can see [his 5 minutes video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE) too)

### The adoption

It took some time, but gradually the whole software engineering community adopted the term, the metaphor and the idea behind the words, building different strategies and protocols behind the **debt-acquisition** and **debt-payment** dynamics, but yet, we're still here talking about that, frustrated and uncomfortable with the whole thing, and THERE is were I stopped and detected a glitch.

## The Mind Glitch

The metaphor was adopted at a great cost, **simply because we're all biased when it comes to financial debt**, the "debt" **signifier** is quiet innocuous but the **signified** is a dark universe! ([signifier/signified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_in_General_Linguistics))

1. Being in debt is something we avoid
2. Owing money is scary
3. Making a client owing money feels WRONG
4. We shouldn’t be leaking our client’s pocket
5. Hiding small money leaking is easy until it isn’t, but it might somebody else's problem by then. (pass the buck factor)
6. No one wants to pay for somebody else’s debts!!!

And it wasn't Ward's fault, it was ours, we individually, introduced the signified bug and cover the **"not-quite-right-code"** thing with such a negative aura that make us struggle to think clearly on the problem.

## The Mind Shift

The first thing you have to do when you feel lost is to calm down and look around to find some references. Going back to the "industry" and "not-quite-right" we can find some "intersections".  
Other industries produce "not-quite-right" stuff along with "the-right" one and the term is **industrial waste**; it can be environmentally friendly,recyclable, sellable, lightly toxic or extremely poisonous and radioactive but they all generate some kind of sub-product during the manufacturing process and they all had to learn to deal with it by law in most cases.  
At this point it becomes crystal clear that **the natural sub-product of the software industry IS TECH-DEBT**. The TTM has mutated from a per-year basis to a per-sprint; the technology also evolves at a thrilling pace; all this means that we're producing an incredible amount of waste, blame the market, the managers, the FOMO related to the tech trends, but eve if I produce the best code today, tomorrow it might be legacy/incorrect/deprecated and that's for the green field only, we're not even including existing legacy code in the equation.

## The Plan

Now what? We detected a glitch but what can we do about it?  
BEING INTENTIONAL.  
It means, let's accept the waste as part of our job and include it in the equation, like a carpenter considers shavings as part of making a beautiful wooden work and does something about it every day, otherwise the carpentry will soon be covered with shavings.
